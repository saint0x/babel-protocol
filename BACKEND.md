# 🏗️ Babel Protocol Backend Architecture

## 📊 Data Storage Strategy

Our backend utilizes a multi-tiered storage approach to balance between performance, decentralization, and data integrity:

### 1. 📦 Hashgraph (Decentralized Immutable Ledger)

Used for data that requires decentralized consensus and immutability:

- **Content Records**
  - Original content posts
  - Comments and replies
  - Evidence submissions
  - Content signatures and hashes
  - Immutable metadata (creation time, author)

- **User Identity**
  - Public keys
  - Username registrations
  - Account creation records
  - Reputation milestones

- **Consensus Data**
  - Truth votes
  - Evidence chains
  - Consensus outcomes
  - Reputation changes

> 💡 **Why Hashgraph?** 
> - Provides Byzantine Fault Tolerance
> - Ensures data immutability
> - Enables decentralized consensus
> - Maintains audit trail

### 2. 💾 SQLite (Local Backend State)

Used for local state management and algorithm operations:

- **Algorithm Data**
  - Performance metrics
  - Error logs
  - Cache entries
  - Feedback data
  - Algorithm parameters

- **Local Content State**
  - Content processing status
  - Temporary metadata
  - Analysis results
  - Local content indices

- **User Session Data**
  - Active sessions
  - Recent interactions
  - Local preferences
  - Temporary user state

> 💡 **Why SQLite?**
> - Fast local operations
> - No server required
> - Perfect for client-side state
> - Supports complex queries

### 3. 🗄️ Object Store (Media & Large Data)

Used for storing large binary and media content:

- **Media Content**
  - Images
  - Videos
  - Audio files
  - Documents
  - Large datasets

- **Backups & Archives**
  - Historical data
  - Analytics snapshots
  - System backups
  - Large exports

> 💡 **Why Object Store?**
> - Efficient large file handling
> - Cost-effective storage
> - Easy CDN integration
> - Scalable architecture

### 4. ⚡ Redis (Real-time Data)

Used for caching and real-time operations:

- **Real-time Metrics**
  - Active user counts
  - Content engagement
  - System health
  - Performance metrics

- **Caching Layer**
  - User feeds
  - Content previews
  - Search results
  - Algorithm outputs

> 💡 **Why Redis?**
> - Ultra-fast operations
> - Perfect for real-time data
> - Built-in data structures
> - Automatic expiration

## 🔄 Data Flow

1. **Content Creation Flow**
   ```
   User Input -> SQLite (processing) -> Hashgraph (immutable record) -> Object Store (media)
   ```

2. **Content Retrieval Flow**
   ```
   Request -> Redis (cache check) -> SQLite (local check) -> Hashgraph (verification) -> Response
   ```

3. **Algorithm Processing Flow**
   ```
   Input -> Redis (cache) -> SQLite (processing) -> Hashgraph (consensus) -> Redis (results cache)
   ```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- **Hashgraph**: Stores cryptographic proofs and consensus-critical data
- **SQLite**: Handles sensitive local state with encryption
- **Object Store**: Implements access control and encryption for media
- **Redis**: Manages temporary sensitive data with TTL

## 🚀 Performance Optimization

- Use Redis for frequently accessed data
- Cache Hashgraph results in SQLite
- Store large files in Object Store with CDN
- Maintain indices in SQLite for fast queries

## 📈 Scaling Strategy

- Horizontal scaling of Object Store
- Redis cluster for increased load
- Multiple SQLite instances for different services
- Hashgraph network expansion for higher throughput

## 🔍 Monitoring & Maintenance

- Regular SQLite vacuum and optimization
- Redis memory monitoring
- Object Store cleanup routines
- Hashgraph node health checks
